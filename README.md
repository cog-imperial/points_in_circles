This repository contains a collection of MINLP test instances available in both .nl and .gms format.

The underlying optimization task is simple, select n-points in m-dimensional balls, such that the l1-distance between all points is minimized. Only one point can be assigned to each ball, and in total there are l-balls with radius one.
